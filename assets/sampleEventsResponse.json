Are you looking to get more active in your community to help protect those who are going to be the most affected by Trump's regressive policies? Are you curious about what the Democratic Socialists of America are all about? Or do you simply want to spend some time with likeminded leftists over a pint or two?\n\nIf the answer to any of these questions is 'yes', you should come hang out with us at our monthly DSA social. Seattle DSA members will be there to introduce themselves and chat about life, leisure, and politics. Bring questions, or simply grab a bite and relax - socialism should be social, and we want to socialize with you. Big Time Brewery is kid friendly until 8pm, little ones welcome!",
